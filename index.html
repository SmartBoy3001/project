    <div class="a">What is it?</div><br> 
    <sp> A rainforest is an area of tall, mostly evergreen trees and a high amount of rainfall.

    Rainforests are Earth’s oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years. 
    They are incredibly diverse and complex, home to more than half of the world’s plant and animal species—even though they cover just six percent of Earth’s surface. This makes rainforests astoundingly dense with flora and fauna; 
    a 10-square-kilometer (four-square-mile) patch can contain as many as 1,500 flowering plants, 750 species of trees, 400 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies.
    
    Rainforests thrive on every continent except Antarctica. 
    The largest rainforests on Earth surround the Amazon River in South America and the Congo River in Africa. The tropical islands of Southeast Asia and parts of Australia 
    support dense rainforest habitats. Even the cool evergreen forests of North America’s Pacific Northwest and Northern Europe are a type of rainforest.</sp> .

<div class="a"> Abiotic Factors </div>
<p> The annual rainfall in the Amazon Rainforest is from around 1500mm to 3000mm. The average temperature is 76<sup>o</sup>
    F and temperatures range from 71<sup>o</sup>F to 91<sup>o</sup>F. The rainforest is pretty humid. The soil quality
    inside the Amazon is poor, without any nutrients.</p>
